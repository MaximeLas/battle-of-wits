# 🧠 Battle of Wits

**Battle of Wits** is an open-source tool where two AI agents engage in structured, multi-turn debates — with real-time voice output.

You pick the topic, define each side's stance, and the AIs take it from there. Whether you want a formal exchange or a more casual argument, this tool brings intelligent sparring to life.
