# üîß Error Handling & Debugging Guide

## Overview
Battle of Wits now has comprehensive error handling that provides clear, actionable feedback when things go wrong. No more cryptic error messages or lengthy debugging sessions!

## üìã What We've Built

### 1. **Smart Error Categories**
- `CONFIGURATION` - Setup and environment issues
- `API_AUTHENTICATION` - OpenAI API key problems  
- `API_CONNECTION` - Network/connectivity issues
- `API_QUOTA` - Usage limits and rate limiting
- `DEBATE_LOGIC` - Issues with debate flow
- `AUDIO_PROCESSING` - TTS generation problems

### 2. **User-Friendly Error Messages**
Instead of: `Exception: API key not found`
You get: 
```
‚ùå OpenAI API key is missing

üí° Suggestions:
  ‚Ä¢ Create a .env file in your project root
  ‚Ä¢ Add OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here to the .env file
  ‚Ä¢ Copy .env.example to .env and edit it with your key
  ‚Ä¢ Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Logging**
- **Console logs**: Clean, timestamped messages during development
- **File logs**: Detailed technical logs with function names and line numbers
- **Automatic log rotation**: Daily log files in `logs/` directory

### 4. **System Status Monitoring**
The UI shows real-time system status:
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API Connected
- ‚úÖ Environment Configured
- Last checked: 04:04:53

## üéØ Common Error Scenarios & Solutions

### 3. **System Status Panel**
Real-time status indicators in the sidebar show what's working

### 4. **Test Scripts**
- `python test_setup.py` - Basic functionality test
- `python test_error_handling.py` - Error handling demonstration

## üöÄ Testing Your Setup

```bash
# Basic setup test

# Full application
streamlit run main.py
```

## üìû When Things Still Go Wrong

If you encounter an error that isn't handled well:

1. **Check the log file** in `logs/` for technical details
2. **Look for the error category** to understand the type of issue
3. **Follow the suggestions** provided in the error message
4. **Check the system status** panel for component health

The error handling system captures most common issues and provides clear guidance for resolution. This should eliminate most debugging headaches! üéâ
